## Git and Github
I've learned a lot of new Git features: 
* Branches and commands that help work with them 
* Commands which help to move between commits
* Work with remote repositories

Also I refreshed my knowledge about main principles of version control system and how version control works.
I repeated the most common and basic commands: git add, git commit, git push, etc. 

I can make conclusion that Git is very useful and powerful tool for developer.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
I have finished a Linux CLI, and HTTP part of course and now I can make some conclusions.I can confidently say lessons were very interesting and useful for me!
* I have learned many new basic and the most common commands for Linux CLI. Also, I've read two helpful articles about HTTP. I have found out more detailed information about HTTP, which has helped me structured my own knowledges.
* I was surprised by differences between Windows and Linux CLI. As for me Linux CLI is more comfortable and ease for understanding than Windows CLI. 
* I confidently say I've started using Linux CLI for my daily activities on computer. Also I wish I started use grep command for improve my work and make it easy.

## Git Collaboration
I have finished Git Collaboration lessons and I can say that they was wery useful.
* I have already understood difference between origin and upstream branches and how remote repo works.Also It is very useful understand difference between fork and clone repositories. Thank you for this!!!
* I was surprised by realizing how branches ease and difficulte work at the same time. It seems so difficulte at the first time but if you try it out to understand the most basic and useful features everything will become more clear.
* I hope I will use all my new knowledges, which will help me optimize my work and make it easier, in future!

## Intro to HTML and CSS
I have finished Intro to HTML and CSS lessons and I can make some conclusions now.
* I have learned more useful that refer to semantic HTML. I have improved my knowledges about Grid layout. Also I have repeated my HTML and CSS knowledges.
* I was surprised by `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags. I hadn't known about them before I completed this lesson. Also I was surprised by `grid-auto-flow` property. It is very useful and I am going to use the tag in future.
* I confidently say that I'm going to implement all my new knowledges in practice in future!

## Responsive Web Design
I have finished responsive Web Design lesson and I can make some conclusion. 
* I've learned a lot of useful information about responsive markup. For example, I have learned new tags and properties such as `picture`,`flex-flow` and `srcset`. All of them are extrimely helpful when you create responsive markup.
* I was surprised how difficult create responsive markup with adaptive images. I was amazed how much tools can be used for create responsive layout. The same result can be represented by different ways.
* I hope and believe I will understand responsive web more clear and try it out in my future projects.
