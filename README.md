## Git and Github
I've learned a lot of new Git features: 
* Branches and commands that help work with them 
* Commands which help to move between commits
* Work with remote repositories

Also I refreshed my knowledge about main principles of version control system and how version control works.
I repeated the most common and basic commands: git add, git commit, git push, etc. 

I can make conclusion that Git is very useful and powerful tool for developer.
